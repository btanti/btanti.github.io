**Lorem ipsum** Hi! I'm Bryan, a Chemical Engineering graduate student at Cornell University. I completed my BS at Cornell University with a double major in Chemical Engineering and Computer Science, and a minor in Electrical Engineering. My interests include machine learning, control of dynamical systems, MEMS, algorithms, sequential decision making, and computational chemistry. Outside of academics I'm an avid hiker and reader. I currently live in Ithaca, NY.
